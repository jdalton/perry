// #7154: a call to a top-level function in the SAME module must root its
// arguments, exactly as the cross-module call #7240 fixed does.
//
// This is the follow-up #7240 named and could not fold in. Its own regression
// test needed a two-file fixture precisely because a same-file callee does not
// take `lower_call/extern_func.rs`'s path at all — it resolves through
// `Expr::FuncRef(fid)` into `lower_call/func_ref.rs`, which had the identical
// defect one `else` away, in four arms rather than one:
//
//     } else if …synthetic `arguments` && rest…  { for a in args { lower } … }
//     } else if …synthetic `arguments`…         { for a in args { lower } … }
//     } else if has_rest                        { for a in args { lower } … }
//     } else                                    { for a in args { lower } }
//
// Every one lowered its arguments into bare SSA registers and then held them
// across work that allocates — the rest arms across `js_array_alloc` plus a
// `js_array_push_f64` per element, the plain arm across the later arguments'
// own lowering.
//
// Why this was not simply copied from #7240: `func_ref.rs` threads `lowered`
// through FOUR specialized-ABI dispatch paths (Tier A static, Tier B guarded,
// and the typed-f64 / i32 / string / i1 clones), each a fast/fallback diamond
// with a phi at the merge. The temp-root release has to sit in the merge block
// that post-dominates all five call sites — releasing on one side of a diamond
// leaves the other side's call reading dropped slots. That is a real change,
// not a one-line copy, which is why #7240 named it instead of guessing at it.
//
// Both protections are exercised, as in #7240: a STRING LITERAL argument is
// `OperandProtection::Reload` (its `__perry_init_strings_*` handle global is a
// registered root that an evacuating cycle REWRITES, so re-emitting the load
// below the collection point is correct and free), and a LOCAL argument is
// `OperandProtection::Root` (re-deriving it could observe an assignment made
// after the call-time value was taken, so it takes a real temp-root slot).
//
// LIVE BY CONSTRUCTION: `churn` keeps allocating AFTER the back-edge poll that
// collects, so the retired from-space bytes are recycled before the callee
// reads them and a stale read returns wrong text rather than the right answer
// out of memory nobody has reused yet.

// Allocates hard, and keeps allocating after the poll that collects.
