// #7154: a cross-module call to a callee with a trailing `...rest` must root
// its fixed parameters AND its accumulating rest array.
//
// #7240 fixed `lower_call/extern_func.rs`'s NON-rest arm and named this one as
// a follow-up it could not ship, because the registry does not exercise it and
// an unmeasured GC edit is exactly what the knob-kill policy exists to stop.
// This is that measurement.
//
// The rest arm has TWO unprotected registers where the non-rest arm had one:
//
//   1. THE FIXED PARAMETERS, exactly as in the non-rest arm — except their
//      window does not close when the last argument is lowered. The rest array
//      is materialized afterwards, and materializing it allocates:
//
//          ; url + method -> bare registers
//          bl   js_array_alloc                ; ALLOCATES
//          bl   perry_fn_…__churn             ; trailing arg 1 -- USER CODE
//          bl   js_array_push_f64             ; ALLOCATES (grow)
//          bl   perry_fn_…__churn             ; trailing arg 2 -- USER CODE
//          bl   js_array_push_f64             ; ALLOCATES
//          …
//          fmov d0, d9                        ; STALE url
//          fmov d1, d10                       ; STALE method
//          bl   perry_fn_…__joinRest
//
//   2. THE ACCUMULATOR, which has no analogue in the non-rest arm and is the
//      more dangerous of the two. `current` is a RAW `*mut ArrayHeader` in a
//      bare SSA register, threaded through the push loop, holding the ONLY
//      reference to every argument pushed so far while the NEXT argument's
//      expression is lowered. Nothing roots it, so a minor landing in that
//      window is free to SWEEP the array — not merely move it.
//
// `temp_root::rooted_array_begin`'s doc has named this exact shape as "the
// shape behind every variadic / spread / rest argument list" since #6951, and
// `console_promise.rs` has used it since. This path never adopted it.
//
// Both protections from #7240 are exercised: a STRING LITERAL fixed parameter
// is `OperandProtection::Reload` (its `__perry_init_strings_*` handle global is
// a registered root that evacuation rewrites, so re-emitting the load below the
// collection point is correct and costs no runtime call), and a LOCAL fixed
// parameter is `OperandProtection::Root` (re-deriving it could observe a later
// assignment, so it takes a real temp-root slot).
//
// LIVE BY CONSTRUCTION, the same way #7240's test is: `churn` keeps allocating
// AFTER the back-edge poll that collects, so the retired from-space bytes are
// recycled before the callee reads them. A stale read therefore returns wrong
// text rather than the right answer out of memory nobody has reused yet.
//
// The literal arm needs the collection EARLY: `__perry_init_strings_*` runs at
// startup, so a literal is young for the first couple of minors and tenured
// after that, and only a young object is evacuated. Under `PERRY_GC_ZEAL=1` the
// first back-edge poll inside `churn` already runs an evacuating minor, so
// iteration 0 is where the literal arm bites.
