# Memory Model

Perry compiles TypeScript directly to native code via LLVM, but JavaScript is a managed language: closures escape, objects outlive scopes, cycles exist. This page explains how Perry reconciles "native binary" with "garbage-collected language" — the value representation, the heap layout, how the GC finds roots, and how LLVM-generated code cooperates with the collector.

If you've ever wondered "does Perry use reference counting?" — no. There is no `Rc` at runtime. Perry has a real tracing GC, described below.

## Value representation: NaN-boxing

Every JavaScript value in Perry is a single 64-bit word. The encoding piggy-backs on IEEE 754: any `f64` whose exponent is all-ones and whose mantissa is non-zero is a NaN, and there are ~2⁵² distinct NaN bit patterns. Perry uses the high 16 bits as a type tag and the low 48 (or 32) bits as the payload.

| Tag (high 16 bits) | Type | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `0x7FFC…0001` | `undefined` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFC…0002` | `null` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFC…0003` | `false` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFC…0004` | `true` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFA` | BigInt | low 48 bits = heap pointer |
| `0x7FFD` | Object / Array / Closure | low 48 bits = heap pointer |
| `0x7FFE` | Int32 | low 32 bits = signed int |
| `0x7FFF` | String | low 48 bits = heap pointer |
| anything else | `f64` | the full 64 bits are the number |

Source: `crates/perry-runtime/src/value.rs`.

Three consequences worth noting:

1. **Numbers are free.** A plain `f64` value is its own representation — no boxing, no header, no allocation. Numeric hot loops cost nothing in memory traffic.
2. **The GC can identify pointer values from the tag alone.** When tracing a value, the collector masks the high bits, checks for `0x7FFA`/`0x7FFD`/`0x7FFF`, and either follows the low-48-bit pointer or skips. There is no per-value runtime type lookup.
3. **Type checks are bitwise.** `typeof` and many fast paths in the runtime are register-level mask-and-compare operations.

## Heap layout: per-thread arena, nursery + old-gen

Perry is single-threaded by default, and each thread owns its own heap. Sharing across threads happens via deep copy (`SerializedValue`), not shared memory, so the GC never has to synchronize across threads.

Within a thread, the heap is two arenas:

- **`ARENA`** — the nursery. New allocations land here. Carved into 1 MB blocks (since v0.5.196).
- **`OLD_ARENA`** — the old generation. Holds objects that have survived enough minor GCs to be tenured.

Every allocation, in either arena, is prefixed by an 8-byte `GcHeader` (`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc.rs:14`):

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct GcHeader {
    pub obj_type: u8,    // GC_TYPE_ARRAY, GC_TYPE_STRING, …
    pub gc_flags: u8,    // MARKED | ARENA | PINNED | TENURED | HAS_SURVIVED | …
    pub _reserved: u16,
    pub size: u32,       // total alloc size, used for arena block walking
}
```

Callers receive a pointer **after** the header (`ptr + 8`), so from TypeScript code's perspective the header is invisible. The collector finds the header by subtracting 8.

Allocation goes through `gc_malloc(size, obj_type)` (`gc.rs:606`). LLVM-generated code emits calls to this for every object literal, array literal, closure capture, string concat, BigInt operation, etc. There is no allocation primitive in the IR that bypasses this — going through `gc_malloc` is how the GC accounts for live memory and decides when to collect.

## How the GC finds roots

This is the part most people are surprised by: if Perry compiles through LLVM, the optimizer is free to keep values in registers, spill them to stack slots, rematerialize them — none of which the collector can introspect. So how does the collector know which JS values are live?

Three mechanisms, used together:

### 1. Precise shadow stack (codegen-emitted)

Codegen emits, at function entry, a call to `js_shadow_frame_push(slot_count)` (`gc.rs:493`). This reserves a frame in a thread-local shadow stack. Every JS-level local variable in the function gets a slot, and every assignment to that local emits a paired `js_shadow_slot_set(idx, value)` call. On function exit, codegen emits `js_shadow_frame_pop`.

The result: at any GC safepoint, the collector can walk the shadow stack and see the live NaN-boxed value of every TS-level local in every active frame, regardless of what LLVM did with registers. This is the "precise" half of the root scan — `shadow_stack_root_scanner` (`gc.rs:3860`).

### 2. Conservative native-stack scan

Some values are not on the shadow stack — most importantly, anything currently in a CPU register or in a Rust runtime frame at the moment GC fires. For these, the collector scans the native stack word-by-word and, for each word, checks whether it looks like a pointer into one of the arenas. Anything that does is **conservatively pinned** for that cycle (`is_conservatively_pinned`, `gc.rs:3747`).

Pinning means: the object isn't freed, and isn't moved (the evacuation pass skips it). False positives are acceptable — they just keep a dead object alive for one more cycle. False negatives would be catastrophic — they'd free a live object — and the shadow stack + scanner registration below ensure they don't happen for known roots.

### 3. Registered runtime root scanners

Some roots live in the runtime itself, not in user code: pending Promises, timer callbacks, exception state, async-context stacks, async-hooks state, shape caches, transition caches, overflow fields, JSON-parse scratch tables, the string intern table. Each is registered with the collector via `gc_register_root_scanner(scanner_fn)` (`gc.rs:807`), and the collector invokes each scanner during the mark phase. There are 9 such scanners currently registered (`gc.rs:3232`–`3940`).

## Generational behaviour

Most JS allocations die young — object literals in a loop body, short-lived closures, intermediate strings. A generational collector exploits this by collecting the nursery frequently and the old gen rarely.

Perry uses two-bit aging encoded in `gc_flags` (`gc.rs:64`):

- First minor GC an object survives: `GC_FLAG_HAS_SURVIVED` is set.
- Second minor GC it survives: `GC_FLAG_TENURED` is set, and the object is logically promoted to old-gen.

`PROMOTION_AGE = 2`. The two-bit scheme avoids needing a counter field in the header.

Tenured objects initially stay physically where they are in the nursery — promotion is a flag flip, not a copy. A telemetry-driven **evacuation policy** copies tenured non-pinned objects into `OLD_ARENA` and rewrites all references to point at the new locations only when generated write barriers are active and nursery/RSS pressure plus measured movable candidates justify the extra work. Low-pressure cycles, cycles with no movable candidates, and cycles without generated write barriers skip evacuation and reference rewriting.

### Write barriers and the remembered set

Generational collectors have one fundamental problem: if an old-gen object points to a young-gen object, a minor GC (which only traces the nursery) needs to know about that pointer or it will free a live object.

The fix is a **write barrier**: every time a pointer field is written, the runtime checks "is this old → young?" and, if so, records the parent in a **remembered set**. Minor GCs treat remembered-set entries as additional roots.

In Perry, the runtime barrier is always present: `js_write_barrier(parent, child)` (`gc.rs:3773`). Codegen emits write-barrier calls by default so copied minor GC and evacuation can rely on exact dirty-page data. Set `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0`/`off`/`false` during compile to suppress generated barrier calls for benchmark/debug bisection; at runtime, the same setting disables runtime exact helper barriers. Copied-minor and evacuation then treat barrier data as inactive and fall back to conservative paths.

## Triggers and tuning

`gc_check_trigger` (`gc.rs:919`) fires on three signals:

1. **Arena block allocation** — every time a new 1 MB block is allocated for the nursery.
2. **Malloc count threshold** — too many malloc-tracked objects (strings, closures, …) outstanding.
3. **Explicit `gc()` call** from user code.

The next-trigger calculation steps up after each cycle but is hard-capped at the initial threshold (64 MB) so that a workload which frees >90% of the nursery on each cycle can't drift peak occupancy upward through step-doubling (C4b-δ-tune, v0.5.236).

Idle nursery blocks observed empty for 2 GC cycles are `dealloc`'d back to the OS (C4b-δ, v0.5.235), so a workload's RSS shrinks once the burst is over.

## Escape hatches and diagnostics

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` / `off` / `false` | Disable generational mode; fall back to full mark-sweep (intended for bisection only). |
| `PERRY_GEN_GC_EVACUATE=0` / `off` / `false` | Disable policy evacuation. `=1` / `on` / `true` is accepted as "allow the auto-policy", not as unconditional evacuation. |
| `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE=1` | With generated write barriers active and policy evacuation allowed, stress-copy every marked non-pinned nursery object instead of only tenured survivors. |
| `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION=1` | After an evacuation that actually forwards objects, panic if any mutable live slot still points at a forwarded nursery object after rewrite. |
| `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0` / `off` / `false` | Disable codegen-emitted write barriers at compile time and runtime exact helper barriers at runtime for benchmark/debug bisection. Unset, `=1`, `=on`, and `=true` keep barriers enabled. |
| `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1` | Print per-cycle diagnostics, including one evacuation-policy line for cycles where evacuation was considered and for `barriers_inactive` skips. |

## Rooting-bug instruments

A value that is live but not rooted across a collection point leaves nothing
behind at collection time — there is literally nothing for the collector to
find. The nursery then recycles the address immediately, so the stale pointer
reads a valid unrelated object and the program dies a cycle or more later, in a
different function, as `TypeError: value is not a function`. These knobs exist
to collapse that detection latency. **All are default-off and inert when off.**

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1` | After an **evacuating (copying) minor**, do not recycle from-space. Retired Eden and active-survivor blocks are detached into a bounded quarantine, filled with a poison pattern whose first byte reads as an invalid `obj_type` (`0xDE`), and `mprotect(PROT_NONE)`'d over their page-aligned interior. A stale dereference then SIGSEGVs **at the faulting instruction**, with the holder still on the stack. The installed reporter prints the faulting address, which minor retired it, and the last-known object that lived there (`obj_type`, size) plus a native backtrace, then restores `SIG_DFL` and returns so the instruction re-faults — a core file or debugger still sees the real crash site. |
| `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=poison` | As above without `mprotect`: poison only. Use where a fault is unwanted, or for the sub-page block edges `mprotect` cannot cover (those are always poison-filled and counted separately). |
| `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=N` | How many retired page-sets stay quarantined (default `4`, minimum `1`). Expired sets are restored to read/write and **recycled back into Eden**, never freed, so the quarantine is a ring: steady-state footprint is bounded by `N × from-space bytes` and no `mprotect`'d page is ever handed to the system allocator. |
| `PERRY_GC_ZEAL=1` | Force an evacuating minor at **every GC safepoint** — loop back-edge polls and the outermost microtask-pump boundary — instead of only when nursery pressure is due. Implies `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE`, so survivors actually move — but an explicit `PERRY_GEN_GC_EVACUATE=0` still wins, and with it set zeal moves nothing and therefore surfaces nothing. Zeal also does **not** bypass `gc_safepoint_moving_minor`'s entry guards (in-allocation, suppressed, unsafe FFI zone, non-zero root-lock depth, budgeted cycle): a safepoint reached in any of those states still declines to collect. Modelled on V8 `--stress-scavenge` / SpiderMonkey `gcZeal`. Composes with the two above; that pairing is what turns a rooting bug into an immediate precise fault. |
| `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN_ABORT=1` | Abort on the **first** offending slot the whole-heap from-space scan finds, printing slot, holder, target (including the target's `obj_type`) and a collector backtrace. Now implies `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN=1`; previously it was silently inert on its own. |
| `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64>` | **Seeded GC-schedule fuzzing** — collect at a safepoint iff a deterministic pseudo-random function of the seed and a per-thread safepoint ordinal says so. The middle setting between normal pacing and zeal: enough extra collections to turn a rare "what was live when the collector ran" bug into a frequent one, and — because the schedule is a pure function of `(seed, counter)` — **a failing seed is a reproducer**. Implies `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` for the same reason zeal does. A value that does not parse as a `u64` reads as OFF, not as seed 0. |
| `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=<0..1>` | Expected fraction of handled safepoints that collect (default `0.05`). Inert without a seed. `0` selects nothing but still installs the banner and reporters, so it is a clean control arm; `1` is zeal's density. Out-of-range values clamp. |

These instruments have explicit caveats, because each has burned a prior
investigation:

- `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE` gates **only** the copying minor's from-space
  reset. A run with the knob on and zero copying minors protects nothing. Check
  for a `[gc-fromspace-protect] retired_set=#N` line under `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1`.
- **Depth is the knob to raise when a suspected bug does not fault.** A stale
  pointer is only caught while the page-set it names is still quarantined, and
  under zeal a value can cross hundreds of collections between its last valid
  observation and its stale use — one per loop back-edge poll. On #7154's
  `new C(…)` reproducer the constructor body runs 600 polls, so the caller's
  stale register is 600 retirements old by the time the return-override
  publishes it: the default depth of 4 misses it silently, and
  `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=800` faults on the first use. Rule of thumb:
  depth ≥ the number of safepoints the suspect value survives.
- `PERRY_GC_ZEAL` cannot emit loop back-edge polls that codegen never produced.
  Those require the **compile-time** `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1` (default off
  since #7161). Without it, zeal only fires at event-loop boundaries and a
  compute-only loop never collects at all. Compile *and* run with the poll opt-in.
- **`PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`'s determinism is per-thread, and that is the honest
  scope.** The safepoint counter is thread-local: no wall clock, no address, no
  thread identity enters the decision, so a **single-threaded** program replays
  a seed exactly. A `perry/thread` program gets a deterministic schedule *per
  thread given that thread's own safepoint sequence*, but nothing makes the OS
  schedule that sequence identically twice, so a multi-threaded reproducer is
  only as reproducible as its threading. A global counter would be strictly
  worse — it would make even a single thread's schedule depend on interleaving.
  Report which case you measured.
- **A clean sweep means nothing without a safepoint count.** The mode prints
  `[gc-schedule] done: seed=… safepoints=… scheduled_collections=…` at exit, and
  `scripts/gc_schedule_fuzz.sh` refuses to call a sweep clean when every run
  reported zero safepoints — the usual cause being a binary compiled without
  `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1`, which has no in-loop safepoints for a schedule
  to select.
- **Page protection is Unix-only.** `mprotect` / `sigaction` / `sysconf` are not
  exposed by the `libc` crate on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, a target
  `perry-runtime` is genuinely built for. On non-Unix hosts `=1` degrades to
  `poison`, which is visible rather than silent: `bytes_protected` stays `0`
  while `bytes_poisoned` counts the whole retired range.

## Why this design

The combination — NaN-boxing for cheap value representation, per-thread arenas to avoid cross-thread sync, precise shadow stack + conservative stack scan for safe root discovery under an opaque optimizer (LLVM), generational aging for nursery-friendly workloads — is what lets Perry both go through LLVM and run a managed language without a fight.

Going to native code does not preclude having a GC. It just means the GC's relationship with the compiled code is mediated by an ABI: codegen emits calls to `gc_malloc`, `js_shadow_frame_push/pop`/`js_shadow_slot_set`, and `js_write_barrier`, and the runtime crate (linked in as native code) is a real generational mark-sweep collector. There is nothing reference-counted at runtime.

## Profiling Perry's memory on macOS

Two things to know before reading `vmmap`, Instruments' VM Tracker, or
`footprint` output for a Perry binary:

- **The heap does not show up under `MALLOC_*`.** Perry routes all runtime
  allocation through mimalloc (`#[global_allocator]`, issue #62), whose
  mappings appear as their own anonymous regions, not in the system malloc
  zones.
- **Those regions used to render as `IOAccelerator`** — i.e. GPU driver
  memory — because mimalloc tags its mappings with VM tag 100, which macOS
  tooling decodes as `IOAccelerator`. Since #6882 the runtime retags them to
  `VM_MEMORY_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_1` (240) during `js_gc_init`, so the JS
  heap shows up as **`Memory Tag 240`**. If you see large `IOAccelerator`
  regions in a Perry process, you are either on a pre-#6882 build or looking
  at the few pages mapped before `js_gc_init` ran; there is no GPU memory
  involved. Set `MIMALLOC_OS_TAG=<n>` to steer the tag yourself — the
  runtime's retag defers to an explicit env setting.

Also note that mimalloc purges freed memory with `MADV_FREE`-style advice:
macOS keeps such pages counted in RSS and `phys_footprint` until memory
pressure, so headline RSS numbers overstate what the process would actually
hold onto under pressure.
