# The GC rooting invariant (codegen)

Read this before you emit a call from a lowering.

## The rule

> **Any GC-managed value that is live across a collection point must be
> reachable from a root before that point.**
>
> A value read out of a root and held in an SSA register across a call **is not
> rooted**. It is a copy, and the collector cannot see copies.

Perry's GC moves objects. When an evacuating minor runs, it walks the roots,
copies live objects to old-gen, and **rewrites every reference it can reach**.
Anything it cannot reach keeps the old address. That address now points into
from-space, which is about to be reused.

A "collection point" is any of:

- an allocation (`js_object_alloc`, `js_array_alloc`, `js_closure_alloc`, string
  concatenation, boxing — anything that can take an arena block);
- a call that can allocate, which in practice means **almost every runtime
  helper**. `js_object_set_field_by_name` allocates: it performs the keys-array
  transition. `js_object_get_property` allocates: it can run a getter, which is
  user code;
- `js_gc_loop_safepoint`, the back-edge poll (only emitted under
  `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1`, off by default since #7161).

The safe default is that **a call collects unless you have read the runtime
source and proved otherwise**. The checker described below encodes exactly this
bias: its `NONCOLLECTING` set is the only place a call is declared safe, and
every entry names the runtime line that proves it.

## Why this class of bug is so expensive

Every violation presents the same way and none of it points at the code that is
wrong:

- the symptom is `TypeError: value is not a function`, or a SIGSEGV, **cycles
  later and somewhere else** — wherever the stale pointer is finally
  dereferenced;
- **no runtime GC probe can see it.** At the moment of the collection there is
  nothing for the collector to find, so a from-space scan, a verify-roots pass
  and a zeal run all come back clean. `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION` checks that
  reachable slots were forwarded; it cannot check a register it does not know
  exists;
- it is **invisible by default**, because the back-edge poll that triggers it is
  off. A green default test run says nothing about this class.

Four instances shipped in a single day. The detection lag, not the fix, was the
cost every time.

## The five ways it has actually broken

### 1. Slot index past the frame (#7184)

The root store was emitted, and it looked right. But the slot index fell outside
the frame pushed by `js_shadow_frame_enter`, so `js_shadow_slot_bind`
bounds-checked it and **silently returned**. The value was never rooted; the IR
says it was.

*Tell:* a `js_shadow_slot_bind(i32 N, …)` where `N >= the frame size`. There is
no diagnostic — the bind is a no-op by design, because a bounds-check that
panicked would be worse.

### 2. Root store after a collecting call (#7192)

The store was in-frame and correct, but emitted **after** a call that allocates.
Between the allocation and the store, the value lived only in a register.

```llvm
%obj = call ptr @js_object_alloc(i32 4)
%ret = call double @js_call_function(double %a)   ; can evacuate %obj
store ptr %obj, ptr %slot                          ; stores the OLD address
call void @js_shadow_slot_bind(i32 0, ptr %slot)   ; roots a dangling pointer
```

*Tell:* the resulting slot is *rooted* and *dangling* at the same time, which is
why it survives every "is it rooted?" check.

### 3. Method receiver across the argument list (#7206)

The receiver was loaded out of its root, then the argument expressions were
lowered — each of which can allocate — and only then was the call emitted with
the receiver still in the register loaded before the arguments.

*Tell:* a `load` from a root slot, followed by any lowering of a sub-expression,
followed by a use of the loaded register. **Re-read the root after every
collection point** instead of caching the load.

### 4. Computed-read base across the key expression (#7206)

`base[key]` — the base was materialized, then the *key* expression was lowered
(allocating a string, say), then the element read used the stale base.

*Tell:* two operands where one is evaluated first and used last.

### 5. Runtime-cache class (#7226, #7239)

A thread-local or static cell holding a GC pointer that no registered scanner
rewrites. Unlike the register-class bugs above (which go bad intermittently when a
collection lands in a narrow window), a runtime cache goes bad at collection #0
and stays bad.

Real instances: `js_value_typeof` interned its eight result strings in
thread-local `Cell<*mut StringHeader>`s with no registered scanner (#7226);
`json/raw_json.rs`'s cached `"rawJSON"` key (#7226); and the ten runtime caches
in #7239 — `CACHED_ENV`, `CACHED_PERMISSION`, `CACHED_REPORT`, `ERROR_CONSTRUCTOR_PTR`,
`INPUT_HANDLER`, `RESIZE_CALLBACK`, `FRAME_CALLBACKS`, `CURRENT_NEW_TARGET`,
`ACCESSOR_RECEIVER_OVERRIDE`, and `PENDING_FETCH_SIGNAL`.

*Tell:* a thread-local or static cell holding a GC pointer. A test that fails 10/10,
not intermittently, suggests this class rather than a stale register.

**`scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py` is structurally blind to this class** — it
reads emitted LLVM IR and cannot see a runtime table. The instruments that catch it
are `PERRY_GC_ZEAL=1 PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1 PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=800`
on a real workload. When adding a cache of a heap pointer, register it in
`gc_register_mutable_root_scanner` in `gc/mod.rs` in the same commit.

## How to check your work

### 1. The static checker — run this one

**Scope: emitted-LLVM rooting hazards only** — a stale register or an unrooted
alloca in generated code. Within that scope it is the only instrument that sees
a defect before it crashes, which is why it runs first.

**It is blind to three classes, all found the hard way. A clean report is not
evidence for any of them:**

- **Runtime tables and interning caches** (#7231) — it reads emitted IR and
  cannot see a runtime cell. Tell: fails 10/10 rather than intermittently.
- **Unrooted locals in runtime Rust** (#7249) — same reason. It read
  `0 violations` on both sides of a real bug whose fix was a one-line
  `GcSuppressScope` in the `globalThis` bootstrap.
- **Anything its symbol sets do not name** (#7284) — `POLL_CAPABLE_RUNTIME` is
  an *exact emitted-symbol* set. It carried `js_object_get_field_by_name`, which
  codegen never emits, next to `js_object_set_field_by_name`, which it emits
  verbatim. Property sets classified `MOVING: YES`, property gets `MOVING: no`,
  and 31 stale uses were dropped by `--moving-only`. **Audit these sets against
  what codegen actually emits, the way #7227 audits `ALLOC_RE`.**

For the classes above, the instruments that catch them are the zeal/quarantine
arms below and a *dependency-scale* workload — #7280 records 25 curated corpus
files passing while 20 lines of stock zod fail.

```bash
cargo build --release -p perry -p perry-runtime-static -p perry-stdlib-static
./scripts/gc_root_dominance_corpus.sh ir-corpus
python3 scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py ir-corpus --moving-only \
  --allowlist scripts/gc_root_dominance_allowlist.json -v
```

It parses the emitted LLVM IR, builds per-function CFGs, computes real
Cooper/Harvey/Kennedy dominance, and reports every **collection point** that can
run between the instruction producing a GC value and the root store that
publishes it — that is, a collection point the value's root store does **not**
dominate, which is exactly the rule at the top of this page. Dominance is what
makes the report sound in both directions: the producing instruction must
dominate the bind, so the register being rooted really is the one that
instruction produced on every path. It is one-sided: an unrecognised call counts
as collecting, so a gap in its model costs a false positive, never a missed bug.

For a single file you are iterating on:

```bash
PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1 PERRY_INLINE_SHADOW_SLOT=0 \
  ./target/release/perry compile mycase.ts -o /tmp/mycase --trace llvm
python3 scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py .perry-trace/llvm -v
```

Both env knobs matter, for different reasons.

`PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1` is what puts `js_gc_loop_safepoint` in the IR. It
is the only collection point a **back edge itself** introduces — a loop whose
body calls nothing that collects still collects, once per iteration, and only
with this on. So a bug that needs a collection between two points of an
otherwise inert loop body cannot appear in the corpus without it.

It is **not** what makes the `MOVING` classification work, and it is not the
only collection point that can run inside a loop — a `POLL_CAPABLE_RUNTIME`
helper called from a loop body is in-loop too. `movers`
(`gc_root_dominance_check.py`, the `movers` property on `Violation`, `StaleUse`
and `UnrootedAlloca`) counts `js_gc_loop_safepoint`, anything in
`poll_reaching`, **and** anything in `POLL_CAPABLE_RUNTIME` — the runtime
helpers that can re-enter JS, such as `js_object_set_field_by_name`,
`js_object_get_field_ic_miss` and `js_closure_call1`. Those are moving with no
poll anywhere near them.

So: turn the knob on, because it widens what the corpus can express, but do not
read a poll-free function as safe.

### `POLL_CAPABLE_RUNTIME` is by EXACT emitted symbol, and that has bitten twice

`movers` is a set-membership test on the callee name, so an entry that names a
symbol codegen does not emit classifies nothing, forever, and looks exactly
like coverage while doing it. Two rounds of this have now been measured:

1. **A real symbol codegen never emits.** The set carried
   `js_object_get_field_by_name` next to `js_object_set_field_by_name`, which
   reads as symmetric coverage of property access. It is not: codegen emits the
   SET verbatim but lowers every GET to `js_object_get_field_by_name_f64`,
   `js_object_get_field_ic_miss` or
   `js_typed_feedback_object_get_field_by_name_f64`, none of which were in the
   set. Property sets classified `MOVING: YES`, property gets classified
   `MOVING: no`, and 31 `--stale-registers` hits on the gate corpus were dropped
   by `--moving-only` as a result — including the shape that faults
   deterministically under `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1
   PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=800` at zod's `clone`. The protector and the
   checker disagreed; the checker was wrong.
2. **Ten names that were not symbols at all.** `js_apply_function`,
   `js_array_for_each`, `js_array_sort`, `js_call_closure`, `js_call_value`,
   `js_function_call`, `js_invoke_closure`, `js_object_get_property`,
   `js_object_set_property`, `js_string_replace` — extrapolated spellings, none
   of them an `extern "C" fn` anywhere in the runtime. Four of the ten were four
   different ways of saying "call a JS closure", so the single most obviously
   poll-capable operation in the language was covered zero times; the real
   entry points are `js_closure_callN`, which `RECEIVER_SINKS` in the same file
   already spelled correctly.

`--audit-poll-capable` is the gate for this, and `gc-root-dominance.yml` runs it
alongside `--audit-alloc-re` before the build. It fails on any entry that names
no exported `extern "C" fn js_*`. When it goes red, **replace** the phantom with
the symbol codegen actually emits rather than deleting it — deleting turns the
audit green and leaves the hole.

Checking a *plausible* name is not enough. Confirm against emitted IR:

```bash
grep -ho 'call [^@]*@js_[A-Za-z0-9_.$]*(' ir-corpus/*.ll \
  | sed -E 's/.*@([A-Za-z0-9_.$]+)\($/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

`PERRY_INLINE_SHADOW_SLOT=0` makes every root store the `js_shadow_slot_bind`
call form the checker anchors on.

`--stale-registers` (#7206) additionally catches values that are *never* rooted
— read out of a root and held in a register across a collection point. That is
the mode that found cases 3 and 4. It ships and works, but **the gate command
above does not pass it**: the bind-anchored scan is the arm that is baselined by
the allowlist, so cases 3 and 4 only surface when you run this mode by hand.

`--unrooted-allocas` (#7207) covers the remaining shape, and is the one the
bind-anchored check is structurally blind to: the value lives in a plain
`alloca_entry` for its whole lifetime, so there is no `js_shadow_slot_bind` to
anchor on and a scan that starts from binds calls the function clean. It found
`lower_call/new.rs`'s inline-ctor `this_slot` independently of any runtime
probe.

**The gate runs this mode as of #7236, and the corpus reads 0.** It could not
before: #7210 measured 66 hits and triaged every one as a false positive, #7235
split the heap-source predicate by movability (98 → 2 on a grown corpus), and
the 2 residuals were one bug — `collectors/pointer_locals.rs` classified
`Type::Symbol` as an immediate, so a `Symbol` local got no shadow slot at all.
Run it by hand when you touch an `alloca_entry` site:

```bash
python3 scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py .perry-trace/llvm \
  --unrooted-allocas --moving-only -v
```

### 2. The runtime instruments — second, and mind the depth

From #7196:

- `PERRY_GC_ZEAL=1` — collect at every safepoint. Slow, thorough.
- `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1` — `mprotect` from-space after evacuation so a
  stale read faults immediately instead of reading plausible garbage.
- `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN_ABORT` — now actually runs.
- `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64>` (+ `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE`, default `0.05`) —
  collect on a deterministic pseudo-random schedule instead of at every
  safepoint. Reach for this when zeal is *too* blunt: on a workload whose timing
  zeal distorts enough to kill it somewhere uninteresting, and — more often —
  when you need the failure to come back. The schedule is a pure function of
  `(seed, per-thread safepoint ordinal)`, so a seed that fails is a reproducer,
  which is what turns "1 run in 60" into something you can bisect against.
  `scripts/gc_schedule_fuzz.sh <binary> [seeds]` sweeps seeds and prints a
  reproduce command per failure.

> **A rate is not a substitute for a schedule.** Re-running one binary 60 times
> re-runs one schedule 60 times; with zero failures in `N` runs the 95% upper
> bound on the true rate is only ~`3/N`, so 120 clean runs bound a 1.7% bug at
> 2.5% — no evidence at all. Varying *when* collections fire is the only cheap
> way to explore the space the bug actually lives in.

> **`PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH` defaults to 4, and that default produces
> FALSE GREENS.** Four levels of retained from-space is not enough to still be
> holding the block your stale pointer is in by the time it is dereferenced.
> **Use 800.** A clean run at the default depth means nothing.

Depth is a **detection-window** knob, not a sensitivity knob, and the
difference matters when the two instruments disagree. A page-set enters the
quarantine only because an evacuating minor actually retired it as from-space
(`arena/quarantine.rs`, and the knob gates only
`copying_reset_from_spaces_and_flip`), so *any* fault on a quarantined address
is a genuine stale read no matter how deep the ring is. Raising the depth
removes false NEGATIVES — evicting a set hands its blocks back to Eden, where
the same read silently succeeds — and cannot manufacture a false positive. So
"the protector faulted, but only at DEPTH=800" is never grounds to doubt the
protector; when it disagrees with the static checker, look at the checker first.
That is how the zod `clone` disagreement was settled.

And when a fault does fire, **walk UP the stack**. The reporter names the frame
that DEREFERENCED the stale value, which is usually not the frame that owns the
register — the value commonly arrives as an argument from a caller that let it
go stale.

And remember the ceiling on all of these: if the collection happens while the
only copy is in a register, there is nothing at that moment for any runtime
probe to notice. These instruments catch the *consequence*, later. The static
checker catches the *cause*, now.

## The corpus problem, and the two corpora (#7280)

**A hand-written corpus cannot express this class of bug at dependency scale,
and for a while nobody could tell, because it was green.**

`scripts/gc_root_dominance_corpus.sh` compiles ~124 `test-files/` sources
chosen for the lowerings they exercise. It reads **zero** in both modes the CI
gate runs — and it read zero while twenty lines of stock `zod` faulted
deterministically under `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=800`. #7280 puts it in
one sentence: *25 curated files pass while 20 lines of stock zod fail.*

That is not a size problem. Both corpora were measured on the same compiler with
`--stale-registers --moving-only`:

| corpus | stale uses | what dominates |
|---|---|---|
| curated, 124 sources / 144 modules | 116 | property-GET helper windows, `js_number_coerce`, `js_closure_callN` |
| dependency-scale, 81 modules / 62 MB | 370 | `js_object_assign_one` (object spread) 137, `js_new_function_construct` 102, `js_closure_call*` 30 |

The curated corpus produces 12 of the first population and 1 of the second. A
hand-written test allocates a couple of objects and calls a couple of helpers; a
library spreads objects into objects, boxes every mutable capture because its
closures outlive their frames, and builds values field by field out of data.
**The rooting hazards live in the shapes**, so a corpus without the shapes
cannot express them however many files it has.

So there is a second corpus, generated from a real npm dependency rather than
from anything written for the occasion:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts                       # zod is a package.json devDependency
./scripts/gc_root_dominance_dep_corpus.sh ir-corpus-dep
python3 scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py ir-corpus-dep --moving-only -v
```

`test-files/gc-dep-corpus/main.ts` is the only entry point; the rest of that
directory reaches the compiler by being imported from it, and the generator
**asserts that every `.ts` in the directory produced a module** — which is a
check a size floor could not be, since ~90 modules of `zod` swamp any count a
missing 40-line source would cross.

Nothing is sampled away: all 81 modules and all 62 MB are checked. Emitting
costs ~8s and the two gated arms ~4s, because those are linear in instruction
count. The `--stale-registers` budget is the expensive one (~5 min): its scan is
superlinear, and 62 MB is 62 MB.

## The CI gate

`.github/workflows/gc-root-dominance.yml` runs the checker on every PR over both
corpora. The whole job is a few minutes plus the compiler build; the two gated
checks are about three seconds each over ~2000 and ~12900 functions.

It is built to be able to fail, against all four hazards in CLAUDE.md:

- the checker's exit status is the job's — no `continue-on-error`, no pipe;
- `concurrency` cancels pull-request runs only, so `main` runs are never starved;
- `--min-files` / `--min-binds` / `--min-funcs` refuse a clean verdict over a
  corpus too thin to have exercised anything, and the run prints
  `checked N functions / M modules` so a silently-empty run is visible;
- `--self-test` proves it still fires on planted fixtures, and
  `--seeded-violations 40` splices collection points into the **real** corpus IR
  and requires all 40 to be reported — that is the arm that catches the checker
  silently losing the ability to read perry's output;
- `--audit-alloc-re` and `--audit-poll-capable` refuse a name that matches no
  exported runtime symbol, in the two tables that decide *whether a register has
  a heap-value source* and *whether the window around it is moving*. Both run
  before the build, because both are static and instant and both have shipped
  dead entries: nine in `ALLOC_RE` across two rounds, ten in
  `POLL_CAPABLE_RUNTIME`.

### The allowlist, and why it is not a number

Known-remaining violations live in `scripts/gc_root_dominance_allowlist.json`,
one entry each with a fingerprint, an issue, and a written justification.

A numeric threshold cannot tell a new violation from an old one: fix one bug,
introduce another, and the total is unchanged and the gate stays green. Worse,
under deadline the cheapest way to green a red build is to raise the number by
one, and nothing in the diff says what was conceded.

So the checker enforces three properties:

1. **an entry that matches nothing fails the build.** When you fix the bug,
   delete the entry in the same PR. That is the ratchet, and it is why a fixed
   bug cannot leave a tombstone that quietly widens coverage later.
2. **an entry suppresses at most its `count`.** A second violation of the same
   shape in the same function is new, and fails.
3. **a violation with no entry fails**, regardless of how many entries exist.

Adding an entry is a code-review event. Bumping a `count` to green a build is
the exact thing this file exists to prevent.

### Promoting this gate

**As of this writing the job is NOT in branch protection's required contexts**,
which means it cannot turn a merge red — hazard 2.

Both of the conditions #7198 named are now met:

- the bind-anchored dominance check is green on `main` with an **empty**
  allowlist (the #7211 entries were deleted when that predicate was fixed in
  #7226);
- `--unrooted-allocas --moving-only` reads **0** and is a step in the job
  (#7236). That was the outstanding one: it was 98 before #7235, 2 after, and 0
  once `Type::Symbol` stopped being classified as an immediate.

So the remaining step is for a **repo admin** to add `gc-root-dominance` to
branch protection's required contexts:

```
Settings → Branches → main → Require status checks to pass
  → add:  gc-root-dominance
```

A workflow cannot do this to itself, and neither can a PR. Until it is done,
this is documentation. Per CLAUDE.md's corollary, promote it **after** the job's
first green run on `main` with the `--unrooted-allocas` step included — a gate
that has never been green in its current shape blocks every open PR the day it
becomes required.

## Rules of thumb

- **Root before you call, not after.** If a value must survive a call, its root
  store belongs above the call, unconditionally. Do not predicate it on a
  cleverness about which callees collect — #7211's `ClassExprFresh` tried that and
  only asked about author-supplied initializers, never about the lowering's own
  emitted `js_object_set_field_by_name` calls.
- **Re-read the root after every collection point.** Never cache a load out of a
  root slot across a call. `rooted_handle_get` exists for this.
- **Evaluate-then-allocate is the hazard.** Any lowering with two or more
  operands where one is materialized before another is lowered needs the first
  one rooted.
- **`--trace llvm` and read it.** Three seconds of the checker beats a day of
  bisecting a `not a function` five cycles downstream.
- **When in doubt, root it.** A redundant shadow slot costs a store. A missing
  one costs a day, and it costs it to whoever hits the crash, not to you.
