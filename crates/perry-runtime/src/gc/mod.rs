//! Mark-sweep garbage collector for Perry
//!
//! Design:
//! - 8-byte GcHeader prepended to every heap allocation (invisible to callers)
//! - Arena objects (arrays/objects): discovered by walking arena blocks linearly (zero per-alloc tracking cost)
//! - Explicit malloc objects (promises/maps/errors, large closures, and compatibility residents): tracked in MALLOC_STATE
//! - Mark phase: precise thread-local roots + optional conservative stack scan + type-specific tracing
//! - Sweep phase: free malloc objects; arena objects added to free list for reuse
//! - Trigger: only checked on new arena block allocation or explicit gc() call
//!
//! Low-pause contract:
//! - Normal automatic GC work and mutator assists must eventually advance in
//!   bounded work-unit steps, independent of heap size.
//! - Explicit `gc()` calls may synchronously run the configured collection
//!   because the caller requested that pause; traces distinguish manual minor
//!   work from explicit full collection.
//! - Emergency full collections are reserved for allocation failure recovery,
//!   only outside suppressed, reentrant, or unsafe regions, and must be
//!   reported separately.
//!
//! Threshold-triggered work in `gc_check_trigger()` is debt-paced: heap goals
//! start or resume a budgeted cycle and allocation-side checks spend bounded
//! mutator-assist work instead of running a whole automatic collection.
