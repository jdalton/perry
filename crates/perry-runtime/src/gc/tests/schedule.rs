//! The mode's value rests on exactly two claims, so both are asserted directly
//! rather than inferred:
//!
//! 1. **A failing seed reproduces.** The schedule is a pure function of
//!    `(seed, counter)`, so the same seed selects the same safepoints — checked
//!    over 100k ordinals, not three.
//! 2. **Unset is inert.** Per CLAUDE.md's GC knob kill-policy, every knob's OFF
//!    state is exercised: `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` was inert for every
//!    `gc()`-driven test for months because only its ON arm was ever asserted,
//!    and the ON arm did nothing.
//!
//! A third claim — that the density is actually tunable — is what separates this
//! from zeal, so the realised rate is measured against the requested one instead
//! of being taken on trust from the arithmetic.
