//! The loop back-edge poll's arming word — what `js_gc_loop_safepoint` costs
//! when there is nothing to do.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `js_gc_loop_safepoint` is called at EVERY allocating loop back-edge. In
//! `gc-handoff/bench/churn_alloc.ts` that is 20 million calls, in
//! `churn_alloc_big.ts` 200 million. So what the poll costs on the path where
//! nothing is pending is not a GC cost at all — it is a per-iteration tax on
//! every allocating loop in the language, and it is paid whether or not a
//! collection ever happens.
//!
//! Until this module existed, that path was:
//!
//!   1. `gc_moving_loop_polls_enabled()` — an acquire load on a `OnceLock`,
//!   2. `note_loop_poll_reached()` — an **unconditional** `AtomicU64::fetch_add`
//!      on a process-shared line,
//!   3. `GC_SAFEPOINT_PENDING.with(Cell::get)` — a thread-local read, and on
//!      Darwin **a call to `_tlv_get_addr`**, Mach-O having no local-exec TLS
//!      model,
//!   4. `schedule::gc_schedule_enabled()` — a second `OnceLock` acquire load,
//!
//! all of it behind an out-of-line `extern "C"` call the user module cannot
//! inline. Measured on the quiet bench host at ~3 ns per back-edge, which is
//! exactly the regression #7721 shipped when it turned the polls on by default:
//! `churn_alloc` 0.36 s → 0.42, `push_cls` 0.34 → 0.40, `push_num` 0.13 → 0.17,
//! with `js_gc_loop_safepoint` at 8.2 % and `_tlv_get_addr` at 8–9 % of a
//! profile that had driven `_tlv_get_addr` to 0 % two releases earlier (#7469).
//!
//! #7721 was right about the collector — the polls are the only precise
//! nursery-collection point a compute-only program ever reaches, and turning
//! them off costs `tree_wide` 12.4 s. What was wrong was the poll's *price*.
//!
//! # What the word means
//!
//! [`PERRY_GC_POLL_ARMED`] counts the reasons `js_gc_loop_safepoint` has to do
//! more than return. **Zero is a proof that the poll is a no-op**, which is what
//! lets both ends skip the work on a single ordinary load: codegen emits the
//! load inline and branches around the call entirely
//! (`perry-codegen/src/stmt/loops.rs::emit_gc_loop_safepoint`), and the runtime
//! entry point re-checks it so a module compiled by any other path still gets
//! the cheap answer.
//!
//! It is deliberately a conservative SUPERSET. It is process-global, not
//! thread-local — that is the entire point, a thread-local would reintroduce
//! `_tlv_get_addr` — so it counts *threads with a deferral outstanding*, and a
//! poll on thread B can be woken by a deferral on thread A and find nothing to
//! do. That direction is free: the slow path re-reads the real per-thread
//! `GC_SAFEPOINT_PENDING` and returns.
//!
//! The other direction is the only unsound one: the word reading zero while
//! some thread has a deferral outstanding would strand that collection until
//! the next event-loop boundary. That is why no code outside
//! [`super::policy::set_safepoint_pending`] may write `GC_SAFEPOINT_PENDING` —
//! the `Cell` and this counter are one piece of state with two representations,
//! and `pending_transitions_arm_and_disarm` pins them together.
