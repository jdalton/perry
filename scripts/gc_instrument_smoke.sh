# End-to-end exercised arm for the #7154 rooting-bug instruments
# (`PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE`, `PERRY_GC_ZEAL`).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# CLAUDE.md's GC knob kill-policy is binding: a knob with no arm exercising it
# is a configuration nobody has verified, and this repo has repeatedly paid for
# that (`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` inert for every `gc()`-driven test, #6942 /
# #6946; the matrix's `--pressure` knob disabling the path it measured, #7024).
#
# The *detection* property — "a planted stale from-space deref is caught" — is
# asserted as a unit test in the required `cargo-test` gate
# (`gc/tests/fromspace_protect.rs::quarantine_catches_a_planted_stale_from_space_deref`).
# What a unit test cannot cover is the INTEGRATED path: codegen actually
# emitting back-edge polls, zeal actually firing on them, the copying minor
# actually running, and the quarantine actually retiring its from-space in a
# real compiled program. That is this script.
#
# NON-VACUITY IS THE POINT. Per CLAUDE.md's "four ways a gate can be unable to
# fail" #4, a gate must assert its subject was live. A protected run with zero
# copying minors protects nothing and would pass silently. So this script does
# not merely check the program's output: it requires the zeal arm to produce
# strictly MORE quarantine retirements than the no-zeal arm, which can only
# happen if zeal genuinely forced collections that pressure would not have.
#
# Usage: scripts/gc_instrument_smoke.sh [path-to-perry]
#   Expects target/release/perry and PERRY_RUNTIME_DIR-resolvable staticlibs.

# A deliberately SMALL correct program that still exercises the whole path:

# and the instance survives a collection inside the callee — the #7192 shape),
# called in an outer loop, with the caller reading a field back afterwards so a
# stale read cannot go unnoticed. Sized for ~1200 polls, not #7154's 240k, so
# the zeal arm costs seconds rather than minutes.
